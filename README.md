## Commit Message Convention

In this project, we follow a commit message convention to maintain a clear and organized history of changes. Here are the commit message types and their meanings:

- **feat:** A new feature is introduced with the changes.
- **fix:** A bug fix has occurred.
- **chore:** Changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating dependencies).
- **refactor:** Refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **docs:** Updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files.
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- **test:** Including new or correcting previous tests.
- **perf:** Performance improvements.
- **ci:** Continuous integration related.
- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- **revert:** Reverts a previous commit.
